##Feature Selection and Model Improvement

### Lasso Regression Advantages:

        Eliminate features with coefficients close to zero
        Run model again with reduced features
        Helps identify unnecessary variables

### Project Progress:

        Current version: ~4-5
        Original MVP (Minimum Viable Product) was earlier

### Data Analysis Steps:

        Correlation matrix analysis
        Linear regression
        Residual analysis (required for project 2)
        QQ plot analysis

### Model Improvement Techniques:

        Box-Cox transformation on target variable
        Helps address non-linear relationships

### Key Takeaways:

        Feature selection improves model efficiency
        Residual analysis is crucial for understanding model fit
        Non-linear transformations may be necessary for better model performance
