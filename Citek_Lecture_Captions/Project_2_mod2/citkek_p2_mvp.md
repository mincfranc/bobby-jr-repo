### Data Preprocessing Steps

1. Handle missing values:

   - Option 1: Imputation
   - Option 2: Drop rows with missing values

2. Deal with categorical features:

   - Encode categorical variables

3. Feature scaling:

   - Apply appropriate scaling techniques

4. Regularization:

   - Try different regularization methods

5. Feature selection:

   - Experiment with various feature selection techniques

6. Target variable transformation:
   - Consider Box-Cox transformations if needed

### Project Approach

- Create multiple versions of your notebook:
  - Version 1: Basic linear regression
  - Versions 2-4: Different regularization techniques
  - Versions 5-6: Various feature selection methods
  - Versions 7-9: Different feature selection approaches
  - Versions 10-12: Target variable transformations

### Recommendation

Start with the simplest approach:

1. Begin with linear regression
2. Gradually add complexity in subsequent versions
