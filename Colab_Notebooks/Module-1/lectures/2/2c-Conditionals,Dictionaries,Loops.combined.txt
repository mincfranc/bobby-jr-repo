# Python Exercises - Conditionals, Dictionaries, & Loops
1. Create a dictionary to store information about a famous person. Store their first name, last name, age, and what they are famous for. You should have keys ‘first_name’, ‘last_name’, ‘age’, and ‘famous_for’. Print each piece of information stored in your dictionary. **BONUS**: Use a for loop to print the information.
2. Add the famous person's place of birth to the dictionary you created in #1.
3. A number raised to the second power is called a square (e.g., 3^2 is the square of 3). Use a for loop to print out the square of each integer from 1 to 15.
4. Write a python program that will take a word and print a message stating whether that word starts with a vowel or a consonant. Test it out with several words.



Example input:



```

popcorn

```



Example output:

```

This word starts with a consonant.

```

5. Write a python program that will loop through the following list:

`pets = ['Muffin', 'Kiki', 'Moe', 'Daisy']`. If the length of the pet's name is less than 5 characters, print out the name.  
## **Bonus** (only if you have time)



1. Create the following two lists of numbers:



```

list_1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

list_2 = [9,10,11,12,13,14]

```



Write a program to create a new list such that the new list should contain odd numbers from the first list and even numbers from the second list.
2. Write a program that will check to see if a user's password contains at least one of the following:



*   A number

*   A letter

*   A symbol ($, %, ! or ?)



It should print out 'Good password' if it meets the above requirements and 'Bad password' otherwise.



Example input: 'Hello5?'



Example output: 'Good password'



Hint: `import string` and then use `list(string.ascii_lowercase)` to get a list of all lowercase letters

famous_person = {'first name': 'Harrison', 'last name': 'Ford', 'famous_for': 'Star Wars'}

for _ in famous_person.items():

  print(_)
famous_person.update({"somewhere": "out there"})

for _ in famous_person.items():

  print(_)
for _ in range(0,15):

  print(_ ** 2)
word = 'aop'

vowels = ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')



for letter in vowels:

  if word.startswith(vowels):

   print(f"{word} begins with a vowel")

   break

  else :

   print(f"{word} starts with a consonant")

   break
pets = ['Muffin', 'Kiki', 'Moe', 'Daisy']



for name in pets:

  if len(name) < 5:

   print(f'{name}')
list_1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

list_2 = [9,10,11,12,13,14]
