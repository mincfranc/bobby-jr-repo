# Introduction to Python
## Getting started

- Save this notebook to your Google Drive

- Move it to your Exercises folder for the current module

- Some code cells have a little bit to get you started
## Numbers
Pick your own numbers to perform the following operations:

- addition

- subtraction

- multiplication

- division

- exponentiation

- modulation

## Numbers in variables
Pick two numbers (one integer and one float) and assign them to the variables `first_number` and `second_number`.
Make a variable called `product` that is the product of your two variables from above.  
## Strings in variables
Come up with your own fun sentence to use a string and assign it to a variable name.  (Make sure to pick a variable name that follows the naming conventions.)
## Printing
Make print statements for each of your variables

- first_number

- second_number

- product

- your string
## Displaying types
Print the type of each of your variables

- first_number

- product
- your string
## Exploring
Find a string method that we did not go over in class to use on your string. You can find a list of string methods by checking the [documentation]( https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods ).
