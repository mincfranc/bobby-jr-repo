# Markdown
## Why we care
Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.



**In this class, we will see Markdown in use in the following places:**

- Formatting text cells in Colab/Jupyter notebooks.

- READMEs on Github

- Messages in Slack
**Hint**: When viewing this notebook you can double click on any cell to switch to editing mode and view the original markdown entry instead of the formatted text.
## Headings (#)
Headings in Colab automatically create the Table of Contents on the left (Click on the icon with the three lines to view the TOC.)



 - \# first level heading

 - \## second level heading

 - more \# on down the line
## Lists
- this is my first entry

- this is my second entry

* this is a list entry with a \*



1. this is a list item

2. that is in order
Or you can use all 1s



1. cat

1. dog

1. penguin



## Bold /Italics/ Lines



*This will be all slanty*



**This will be fat**

## Tables
Column 1| Column 2| Column 3|

 - | - | -

Cell 9 | Cell 2 | Cell 3

a new row| with entries| for fun

foo | bar | baz



## Math

You can use LaTeX math notation by using the \$ symbol. Examples:



$ frac{1}{2}$



$\hat{y} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1X_1$
## Indented Blocks / Code


This is not indented



> Indented block



```python

# This is formatted as code

print("Hello, world")

```
