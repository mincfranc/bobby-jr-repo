# Jupyter Notebooks Overview
For this class, we will be using Jupyter Notebooks for most or all of our work.



Jupyter Notebooks consist of:

- Markdown (formatted text) cells

- Code cells (Python in our case although notebooks can be run with other languages)

- Output from code cells



Google Colab is a Jupyter environment.  Jupyter Lab can also be installed locally on your computer and used.



Jupyter notebooks are ideal for data science because we can seamlessly switch between explaining what we are doing and using code.



For example, this is a text cell.
**A big part of data science is communicating your results and explaining your process.**
# Helpful Colab Basics
## Keyboard Shortcuts

|Key Combo|Action|

---|---

Shift + Enter| Run cell  

Ctrl + Shift + S | Select a cell

Ctrl + Shift + Enter | Run Selection

Ctrl + Space | Code Completion

Ctrl + M + H | Open Keyboard Shortcuts

Ctrl + M + Z | Undo Last Cell Action
## Help

Using help or ? will show you the doc string for a function, method or object.
This works on functions
And methods
And objects
## Tab Completion
'Tab Completion' really uses `Ctrl + Space`  unless you turn off auto-completion in settings.  

This will show you available methods and attributes.

Using tab completion when importing packages
##  Colab as a virtual environment

Colab is a Jupyter environment that runs in the cloud.



Beyond just editing a Jupyter notebook, you get a runtime that it's connected to (basically a virtual machine, i.e. VM).



You can do a lot of things that take advantage of this like

- run shell commands

- save files to the VM (these are temporary as they are lost when the notebook is closed)



Running shell commands with !

  - !ls

  - !pip install ...



In fact, you can generally run these without the `!`



(For `cd` you want `%cd` instead)

## Sharing your notebooks
Sharing options are consistent with Google Drive in general.  



Sharing Options:

- Private

- Public

- Specific people

- People with the link

- If you put something in a shared folder, it will automatically be shared too

## Saving your notebooks & revision history
*   You can save your notebook by going to File -> Save.

*   File -> Save and Pin Revision will pin the version so it doesn't get deleted from the revision history.

*   File -> Revision History will show your notebook's revision history. This can be useful if you need to revert back to a previous version of your notebook.

## Moving your notebooks

- Demo how to move notebooks in Drive

- Save somebody else's notebook - File -> Save a copy in Drive
