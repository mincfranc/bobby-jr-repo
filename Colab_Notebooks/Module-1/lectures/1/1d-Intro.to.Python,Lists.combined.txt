# Python Exercises - Intro to Python & Lists
## Working with lists
1. Use a variable to represent a famous person’s name and then print that person’s name in lowercase, uppercase and title case.
2. Print a message about the person you defined above using an f-string.
3. Store the names of at least 5 of your favorite movies in a list called `movies`.
4. Remove one of the movies from your `movies` list.
5. Sort your `movies` list in reverse alphabetical order.
6. Use a slice to access the first 3 of your favorite movies.
7. Add your least favorite movie to your `movies` list.
8. Convert the float `16.4` to an integer.
## Challenge (only if you have time)



1. Create a variable called `birthday` and set it equal to the string `'Happy Birthday to You!'`. Use slicing to access every other character in `birthday`.
2. Create a variable called `nested` and set it equal to the following nested list: `[[1,2,3], ['a','b','c']]`. Use indexing to access the `b` from your nested list. Use indexing to access `[2,3]` from your nested list.
name = "Charlie Sheen"

NAME = "CHARLIE SHEEN"

Name = "Charlie Sheen"
f"that actor, you know - {NAME}"

# I made an f string

f"that actor, you know - {name.title()}"
movies = ["Barbarian","LOR","Final Fantasy: The Spirit Within","Yes Man","Meet the Fockers"]
movies.remove("LOR")

movies
movies.sort(reverse = True)

print(movies)
movies[0:2]
movies.insert(5, "N/A")
movies
int(16.4)
birthday = "Happy Birthday to You"
birthday
birthday.rsplit()
word = "hello"

letters = list(word)

print(letters)
birthday = list(birthday)

birthday
birthday[6:14:2]
nested = [[1,2,3],['a','b','c']]
((nested)[1])[1]
type(nested)
nested[1]
nested[0]
((nested)[0])[1:3]
