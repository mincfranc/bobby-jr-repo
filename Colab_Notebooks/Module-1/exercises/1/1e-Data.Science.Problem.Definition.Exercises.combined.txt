# Data Science Problem Definition

For each item develop a well-worded data science problem statement.  Your answer should include what type of data science problem this is ( supervised vs unsupervised ) and then whether it is a classification, regression, or clustering problem.  If it is a supervised problem, you should state what the target of the prediction is.
1. Zillow wants you to predict real estate sales prices. They have a large

database of 12 years of home features accompanied by the corresponding

sales prices.

about to terminate their service BEFORE they terminate so that they can offer

enticements to the customer to keep the service and not terminate (called

‘churn’)

5. Comcast wants you to develop a chat bot (automated customer service) to
