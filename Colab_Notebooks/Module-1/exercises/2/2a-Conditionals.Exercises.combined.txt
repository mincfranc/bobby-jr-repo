# Conditionals Exercises
1. Print 'A is really BIG!' if a is greater than b.



```python

a = 900

b = 7

```
2. If a and b are equal print 'These things are the same'.  Otherwise, print 'These things are not the same'.



```python

a = 2

b = 4

```
3. If a is greater than b AND b is greater than c, print your own silly sentence.



```python

a = 9

b = 5

c = 2

```
4. If your favorite ice cream is in the list of flavors, print 'I am so happy!'



```python

flavors = [

  'chocolate',

  'vanilla',

  'strawberry',

  'chocolate-chip',

  "Ben and Jerry's Half-Baked",

]

```
5. Make a list called mypets with your pets (real or imaginary) as elements.  

- if mypets contains 'dog' and 'cat', print 'I am a dog person and a cat person'

- else if mypets contains 'dog', print 'I am a dog person'

- else if mypets contains 'cat', print 'I am a cat person'

- otherwise, print 'I am not a cat person or a dog person'



```python

mypets = [  ]

```

a = 900

b = 7

if a > b:

  print("A is really BIG!")
a = 2

b = 4

if a == b:

  print("These things are the same.")

else:

  print("These things are not the same.")
a = 9

b = 5

c = 2

if a > b and b > c:

  print("A is alpha for a reason.")

else:

  print("A? it isnt that great.")
flavors = [

  'chocolate',

  'vanilla',

  'strawberry',

  'chocolate-chip',

  "Ben and Jerry's Half-Baked",

]

if 'sorbet' in flavors:

  print('I love sorbet!')

else:

  print('I wish I had sorbet (I know it isnt ice cream TECHNICALLY)')

mypets = ["dog", "cat"]

# mypets = ["cat"]

# mypets = ["dog"]

# mypets = ['iguana']

if "dog" in mypets and  "cat" in mypets:

  print("I am a dog and a cat person")

elif "dog" in mypets and "cat" not in mypets:

  print("I am a dog person")

elif "cat" in mypets and "dog" not in mypets:

  print("I am a cat person")

elif "dog" not in mypets and "cat" not in mypets:

  print("I am not a dog or cat person")

else:

  print("I somehow ended up here")
