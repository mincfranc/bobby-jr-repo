# EDA Exercise
In this exercise, you will read in your data, do some preliminary data cleaning, and do EDA to better understand your data.



[The dataset]( http://ddc-datascience.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/auto-mpg.csv ) for this exercise is saved in an Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) S3 bucket. The original source and details about this dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG).



Below are the steps you'll need to perform for the EDA. Make sure to use text blocks to organize your analysis.  Discuss any trends/relationships/issues you discover at each step in the analysis.



1. Import `pandas` as `pd`, `matplotlib.pyplot as plt`, and `seaborn as sns`.

1. Read in the csv file found at http://ddc-datascience.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/auto-mpg.csv .

1. Understand your data by using at least 4 pandas methods (e.g., `.head()`).

1. Make a copy of your data frame. In your copy, remove any rows that contain null values.  

1. Calculate summary statistics on one or more columns.

1. Generate at least 3 univariate plots.

1. Generate a correlation plot.

1. Generate a pairplot.

9. If we were going to build a predictive model ( supervised learning ) using this dataset, what do you think would be a good response ( aka target ) variable and why?
## Step 1: Import



Import pandas as pd, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and seaborn as sns.
## Step 2: Get data

Read in the csv file found at http://ddc-datascience.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/auto-mpg.csv .

## Step 3: Understand data

Understand your data by using at least 4 pandas methods (e.g., .head()).

## Step 4: Copy and clean

Make a copy of your data frame. In your copy, remove any rows that contain null values.

## Step 5: Summary stats

Calculate summary statistics on one or more columns.

## Step 6: Univariate plots

Generate at least 3 univariate plots.

## Step 7: Bivariate plot (1/2)

Generate a correlation plot.

## Step 8: Bivariate plot (2/2)

Generate a pairplot.

## Step 9: Conclusion

If we were going to build a predictive model ( supervised learning ) using this dataset, what do you think would be a good response ( aka target ) variable and why?
I think that mpg is the target because of how all of the other variables have outsized correlation to effects with mpg
