May not apply depending on interview format).\n","- Don't get hung up if you don't know how to do a part\n","  - **If you don't know the Python syntax, just use English to fill in the part you don't know**.  (i.e. if you need to sort a list, but don't remember the name of the sort method just write in `sort list`.  Say something like \"I know there is a built-in method to sort the list, but I'd have to look it up to remember what it's called so I'm just going to say sort list for now.\")  This is sort of combining psuedocode and Python code which is 100% OK.  \n","- **TALK the whole way through**.  If you go quiet they don't know what you are thinking.  Even if you say, \"I'm thinking through how to approach this part... the part that I find tricky is trying to make sure that it doesn't print Fizz when it's divisible by 3 AND 5.\"\n","- You can **start by reading the problem out loud** to give yourself some time to start thinking about it.  \n","- **Then start with basics and whatever part of the problem you DO know how to solve right away** so you have time to think through the rest of the problem.  For example the fizzbuzz question says 'Write a function...' so start with that part.  Talk through it... \"Functions in Python start with def and then the function name.  I'll call it fizzbuzz because then it will be obvious what the function does.  The problem says it should take a number 'n' so the input to the function will be 'n'.\" Then here's your code for that part: `def fizzbuzz(n):`\n","- **Refer back to the problem and try to remember what the goal is.**  \"The problem says that the function should print out these things so everything will be print statements instead of using a return statement.\"\n","- **Keep the goal of the problem in mind.** Sometimes it helps to work through backwards a little too.  For example if a question asks you to return a specific thing you can start with:   \n","`def myfunction(n):`  \n","`answer = []`  \n","`return(answer)`  \n","Then you can start in on your code to build `answer`.  This helps to keep you on track for your final goal. While you're doing this part, you might say something like \"The question says to return the value so I'll start by defining an empty list named answer to put the answer in and then I'll put the return statement at the end.\""]}]}
