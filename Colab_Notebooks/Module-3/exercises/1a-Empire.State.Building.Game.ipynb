We would then simulate this sequence multiple times to calculate the probability of reaching step 60 in 100 tries using the Dice game logic.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"rIAQoik6k7EW"},"source":["#Rules\n","For each random walk sequence we throw a Die.\n","1. Step 0 at ground level, is the starting point.\n","2. If the roll of the Die returns 1 or 2, climb down one step.\n","3. If the roll of the Die returns 3, 4 or 5, go up one step.\n","4. If the roll of the Die returns 6, throw the Die again and advance the number of steps equal to that throw.\n","5. There is a little chance of being clumsy and falling down the Stairs in which case we start again from 0.\n","6.
