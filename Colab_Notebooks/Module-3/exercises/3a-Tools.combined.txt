Complete as many of the following problems as possible. **BONUS**: Make the functions interactive.



1. **Password Generator** - Create a function that takes the length of the password and generates a random password of the same length with atleast one character, one number and one symbol. Example: ```password(5) -> 'arg5!'```



2. **Email Slicer** - Create a function that takes as input an email address and returns a string that contains two items - the person's username and the domain name. Example: ```email_slicer('nevin@cnm.edu') -> ('nevin', 'cnm.edu')```

3. **Acronym Creator** - Create a function that takes as input a string and returns an acronym that contains the first letter of each word in that string. Example: ```acronym_creator("My name is Nevin") -> "MNIN"```



4. **Dice Roller** - Create a function that takes as input a positive integer `n`. This function should simulate the rolling of a `n`-sided die 1000 times. It should create a seaborn countplot of the distribution of die rolls.



5. **Max of Three** - Create a function that takes as input three floats and returns the largest of the three. Do this without using the Python max() function! Example: ```max_of_three(5,10,3) -> 10```



6. **Age Calculator** - Create a function that takes as input someone's age in years and prints their age in days, hours and minutes. Example: ```age_calculator(33) -> "You are 12045 days old. You are 289080 hours old. You are 12592800 minutes old."```
