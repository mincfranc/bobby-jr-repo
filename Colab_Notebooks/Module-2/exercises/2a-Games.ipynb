It should print out the winner along with a message about how they won (e.g., \"The computer won. Scissor cuts paper\").\n","\n","2. **MadLibs** - In this game, you will request string input from the user (adjectives, nouns, verbs, etc.) and then you will use that input to generate and print out a MadLibs story. Make sure to format the string input so that it looks nice in your story.\n","\n","3. **Number Guesser** - This is a simple guessing game where the computer will generate a random number between 1 to 10, and the user has to guess it in 5 attempts. Based on the userâ€™s guess, the computer will give a hint if the number is high or low. When the user correctly guesses, print the answer along with the number of attempts.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bYSTNPA6b5o1"},"source":["## Rock, Paper, Scissors"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"p81qeawokOb_","outputId":"e12023a8-4278-4dd8-8fed-cf5057f1e6a2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1729030458300,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":10962,"user":{"displayName":"Robert Balch II","userId":"00793130012574309533"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["How many games would you like to play? 3\n","\n","Game 1 of 3\n","Enter rock, paper, or scissors: rock\n","\n","User chose rock, computer chose scissors.\n","\n","Rock smashes scissors!
